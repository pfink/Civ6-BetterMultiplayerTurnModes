			<Text>Players at peace take their turns at the same time. Players at war take their civil actions at the same time, but their military actions sequentially (multiple times per turn). Military units cannot attack or move while another player has the control over his military actions, but civil actions are still possible while other players do their military actions. Every war participant has a limited budget of military actions. When it's exhausted, the control over military actions is passed on to the next player. The control over military actions is passed on over and over again until everybody has done all military actions he wants to do and ended his turn. "Multi-Turn" means that war participants will often get control over their military units multiple times per turn in case the budget is not sufficient to do all necessary actions at once, so their may will be an exchange of military strikes between players multiple times per turn. This is the recommended BMTM turn mode as it adds more tactical deepness to warfare between players, as the decision which military actions they do first within a turn will may have an impact on the war outcome. Also, it accelerates war pacing because wait times will be shorter until the next military actions can be done.</Text>

			<Text>Players at peace take their turns at the same time. Players at war undergo two turn phases: First, they do their military actions sequentially. After all players at war completed their military actions, they enter a civil actions phase afterwars. This turn mode was implemented by Firaxis in the code of the game core, but for some reason they decided to not to make it available to players. The BMTM mod activated this hidden turn mode, but it's untested and unsupported. The implementation of this turn mode is not accessible to modders which means possible bugs cannot be fixed by the BMTM mod.</Text>
